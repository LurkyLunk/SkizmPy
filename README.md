)

## Overview

SkizmPy is a minimalistic lightweight graphics engine developed using Python, Pygame, and PyOpenGL. It provides a simple framework for creating 2D and 3D graphics applications, games, and simulations with ease.

## Features

- **2D and 3D Graphics:** The engine supports both 2D and 3D rendering, making it versatile for various types of applications.
- **Pygame Integration:** Utilizes Pygame for window management and user input handling.
- **OpenGL Support:** Leverages PyOpenGL to access the power of OpenGL for accelerated graphics rendering.
- **Cross-Platform:** Works on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Easy to Extend:** Designed to be modular and easy to extend with custom shaders and components.
- **Sample Projects:** Includes sample projects to help you get started quickly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- PyOpenGL

You can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame PyOpenGL
```

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with SkizmPy:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skizmpy.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd skizmpy
   ```

3. Run one of the sample projects to see the engine in action:

   ```bash
   python samples/sample_2d.py
   ```

   You can explore other sample projects located in the `samples` directory.

4. Start building your own graphics application by modifying the sample projects or creating new ones.

## Usage

To use SkizmPy in your projects:

1. Import the necessary modules:

   ```python
   import pygame
   from OpenGL.GL import *
   from engine import *
   ```

2. Initialize the engine:

   ```python
   engine = Engine2D()
   ```

   Replace `Engine2D()` with `Engine3D()` if you want to work in a 3D context.

3. Create and customize your scene, add objects, and define shaders as needed.

4. Start the game loop:

   ```python
   while True:
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               pygame.quit()
               quit()

       engine.update()
   ```

5. Customize and extend SkizmPy to suit your project's requirements.
